# Electron and Hole Mobility Calculations in GaN
This Quantum Espresso tutorial (https://docs.epw-code.org/doc/GaN-II.html) was carried out as part of my semester project in Solid State Physics in the Fall of 2021. The EPW code was used to calculate the electron and hole mobilities of the high mobility semiconductor GaN with the linearised iterative Boltzmann transport equation (IBTE) and the self-energy relaxation time approximation (SERTA). The EPW code requires both the electron and phonon band structures as inputs. The results in this work have serious limitations due to the k-points (2x2x2) and q-points (2x2x2) sampling, leading to error in the electron and phonon band structure calculations, respectively.
