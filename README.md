The change in Gibbs free energy and adsorption energy of select solid/liquid/gas interface reactions were calculated from first-principles. The work consists of kinetic energy cutoff convergence, k-point convergence, variable cell and atoms relaxations, total energy, zero point energy, vibrational free energy, electronic free energy, and electron and hole mobility calculations of various compounds. Some of this work was completed during my Solid State Physics course and the rest was my research. You are free to use the input files as you wish.
